Alchemy
=======
Project Description
-------------------

Alchemy is a metabolic pathway generator. It has a comprehensive database of over
50,000 small molecules and 450,000 reactions catalyzed by approximately 1,500 human
enzymes.

Alchemy helps you generate the minimum enzymes and cofactors required to turn one
substance into another (lead, into gold)

This is a senior project for my degree in bioinformatics, and is released under the GNU
GPL3.

Current Goals
-------------

Add more enzymes to the database. Create a web interface so that users may conduct
queries in an efficient manner. Improve graph representations. Increase query
speed.
